**\# Treasury and Token Deployment Project\*\***\## Overview**This project contains Solidity smart contracts and deployment scripts to manage a governance token (\`MANA\`), utility token (\`FYREToken\`), and a \`Treasury\` contract on Ethereum-compatible networks. The project is designed to deploy and manage tokens with features like minting, governance voting, and ownership transfer. The \`HelperConfig\` contract provides network configuration and helps manage addresses across deployments.**\### Contracts**1\. **\*\*FYREToken\*\*** - A utility token used within the ecosystem.2. **\*\*MANA\*\*** - A governance token with voting rights for decentralized governance.3. **\*\*Treasury\*\*** - Manages assets and controls token minting and governance functions.4. **\*\*HelperConfig\*\*** - Manages configuration for different networks and stores addresses of deployed contracts.**\## Prerequisites**\- **\*\*Foundry\*\***: Ensure Foundry is installed. \[Installation Guide\](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)- **\*\*Environment Variables\*\***: Set up a \`.env\` file for local and testnet deployment variables (e.g., deployer keys, token addresses).**\## Installation**Clone the repository and install dependencies:\`\`\`bashgit clone cd Treasuryforge install\`\`\`**\## Environment Configuration**Create a \`.env\` file in the root directory with the following variables. Adjust the values based on your setup:\`\`\`plaintext# Local private keyLOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY=\# Anvil (Local Development) Deployment VariablesANVIL_FYRE_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000ANVIL_MANA_TOKEN_ADDRESS=ANVIL_DEPLOYER_KEY=ANVIL_TREASURY_ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000# Testnet/Aurora variablesPRIVATE_KEY=AURORA_TESTNET_RPC_URL=https://testnet.aurora.dev\`\`\`**\## Contracts\***\*\### FYREToken.sol**\- **\*\*Purpose\*\***: The \`FYREToken\` contract is a utility token with minting functionality for distribution within the ecosystem.- **\*\*Constructor Parameters\*\***:  - \`address deployer\`: The address of the initial deployer.  - \`uint256 initialSupply\`: The initial supply of tokens to mint to the deployer.- **\*\*Functions\*\***:  - \`mint(address to, uint256 amount)\`: Allows minting additional tokens.**\### MANA.sol**\- **\*\*Purpose\*\***: The \`MANA\` contract is a governance token, giving holders voting power within the ecosystem.- **\*\*Constructor Parameters\*\***:  - \`address treasury\`: The initial treasury address, which can mint new tokens.  - \`bytes32\[\] memory defaultPartitions\`: Default partitioning for token categorization.- **\*\*Functions\*\***:  - \`mint(address to, uint256 amount, bytes32 partition)\`: Mints tokens to the specified address.  - \`allocateGovernanceVotes(address voter, uint256 amount)\`: Allocates voting power to token holders.  - \`voteForGovernance(uint256 proposalId, uint256 amount)\`: Casts votes for a governance proposal.**\### Treasury.sol**\- **\*\*Purpose\*\***: The \`Treasury\` contract is designed to hold and manage assets, control token minting, and facilitate governance actions.- **\*\*Constructor Parameters\*\***:  - Addresses for tokens and authorized signers, along with conversion rates for different assets.- **\*\*Functions\*\***:  - \`transferOwnership(address newOwner)\`: Transfers contract ownership to the specified address.**\### HelperConfig.sol**\- **\*\*Purpose\*\***: Stores configuration data for different networks and manages contract addresses.- **\*\*Functions\*\***:  - \`getNetworkConfig(uint256 chainId)\`: Returns network configuration based on the chain ID.  - \`setDeployedFYRETokenAddress(address \_fyreTokenAddress)\`: Sets the address of the deployed \`FYREToken\`.  - \`setDeployedMANAAddress(address \_manaAddress)\`: Sets the address of the deployed \`MANA\`.  - \`setDeployedTreasuryAddress(address \_treasuryAddress)\`: Sets the address of the deployed \`Treasury\`.**\## Deployment Workflow**The following steps guide you through deploying each contract in the correct order. For local deployments, Anvil is recommended.**\## Using \`make\` Commands for Local and Aurora Testnet Deployment\*\***\### Local Deployment**\- **\*\*Deploy all contracts and transfer ownership locally:\*\***  \`\`\`bash  make deploy-all-local  \`\`\`  markdown**\# Project Deployment and Testing Instructions\***\*\## Local Deployment\*\***\## Deploying Contracts\***\*\### Local Deployment**To deploy contracts locally, use the following \`make\` commands:\`\`\`bashmake deploy-fyre-localmake deploy-mana-localmake deploy-manatoken-localmake deploy-treasury-localmake transfer-ownership-localmake deploy-all-auroraDeploy FYREToken on Aurora Testnet:bashmake deploy-fyre-auroraDeploy MANA on Aurora Testnet:bashmake deploy-mana-auroraDeploy ManaToken on Aurora Testnet:bashmake deploy-manatoken-auroraDeploy Treasury on Aurora Testnet:bashmake deploy-treasury-auroraTransfer ownership of all tokens to Treasury on Aurora Testnet:bashmake transfer-ownership-auroraTestingRun the following command to compile and test the contracts:bashforge testLicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
